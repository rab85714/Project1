# Project 0

Web Development CSCI 4300 Term Project - Group 17

To start, the entry point of this project is login.php. Start the project by turning on XAMPP servers and going to your local host and file path for login.php.

Functionalities are to login to the website, view the menu and locations of this restaurant (Mario's Bistro), and add/delete menu items to/from your cart.

This has been tested using Chrome for Mac.

We did not import any libraries/frameworks.

The code we began with was a simple website/html pages, and gutted it, only changing CSS. We mostly used that example html starter for the header and footer (design). We changed mostly everything, apart from header and footer.
