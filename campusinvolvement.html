	    To the left is a picture of my parents and I after one of my lacrosse games in the Spring of my sophmore year. I am so lucky to have them, as they are always so supportive of everything I do. Lacrosse is something I am so glad that I make time for in my busy college schedule. I've been a player on this team since my freshman year, and was lucky enough to be the <q> event coordinator </q> my sophomore year. In this role, I organized team building events, such as team dinners and other social functions, so that we were well gelled off the field, which inevitably makes for a very cohesive unit on the field. At the end of my sophomore year (Spring 2020) I was voted to be Caption of the team for next season. I am so excited for this amazing opportunity and can't wait to see what the future holds for this team, and am so excited to practice my leadership skills in the role of captain!

	  Kappa Delta has been another amazing opportunity for me to further test my leadership abilities. To your right, you will see a picture of the other Executive Board members as well as myself. I have been blessed with the opportunity to serve my chapter as the Secretary! In this position, I handled the roster, financial standing, academic standing, email communication service, and attendance of over 300 members. It was a big responsibility! When I enherited the position, we handled the attendance using a manual system of calling role. It was a tedious task, and one I found could be done much more efficiently. Using a service our National Headquarters was already financing, but my particular chapter had not yet implemented, I transitioned the entire chapter to an Application called OmegaOne so our attendance at events was now automated. So far, much positive reivews have come of it and I am constantly looking for more ways to improve Sigma Phi.
